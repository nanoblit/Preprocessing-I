        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Since childhood I've been interested in computers, programming and making games. Through the years I dabbled in
          C++, Java, JavaScript and C#. I made a few small games and went to university to study Computer Science. I
          learned there how to finish tasks on tight deadline from having to learn for exams for many different subjects
          at once. After two years I decided I wasn't learning enough of what I was interested in and was wasting my
          time on subjects like electrical engineering. I left to continue learning on my own. I went to multiple game
          jams (hackathons where you create games, often in teams) where I learned a lot about teamwork and good
          communications skills. Later on I found Lambda School, a truly modern coding school, which teaches its
          students through lectures, small and big projects. I decided to take the chance and join to become a web
          developer. Participating in game jams and Lambda School have taught me a lot about problem solving and helped
          me improve my work ethic. Now I'm excited to learn more about new skills, tech and frameworks.
